<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<p>At this point you should have installed the Smart Card Shell. If not, please have a look
   at the <a href="installation.html">installation instructions</a>.</p>
<p>After you started the Smart Card Shell and selected a working directory, you will see
   a window divided into two panes. The left pane will be empty and the right pane will show a
   text area, which works as a console and is the main user interface of the Smart Card Shell.</p>
<p>The left pane is called the outline. It will be filled with informations generated when you
   run scripts. You can drag the divider between the two panes and change the amount of space
   allocated to the outline and the text area.</p>
<p>To end the shell, you can either enter "quit" into the text area or select "Exit" from the "File"
   menu.</p>
<h2>Quick Start</h2>
<p>Insert a smart card into your reader and enter:</p>
<pre>
&gt r
</pre>
<p>If everythings is installed correctly, then you should see the Answer to Reset (ATR) for your card.</p>
<p>If you feel like more, try</p>
<pre>
&gt load("tools/explore.js");
</pre>
<p>and see for yourself.</p>
<h2>Understanding the Shell Concept</h2>
<p>The Smart Card Shell uses a JavaScript interpreter and compiler to execute scripts. JavaScript is a
typeless, object-oriented programming language commonly used in web browsers for active HTML pages.
The language syntax is very similar to Java and C.</p>
<p>The shell is directly connected to the JavaScript interpreter, so any input in the text area
must be valid JavaScript code. Whenever you enter a command into the shell, this command is evaluated
by the interpreter, executed and the resulting value displayed to the user. Give it a try and enter:</p>
<pre>
&gt 1000 + 2000
</pre>
<p>After pressing ENTER the shell will display</p>
<pre>
3000
&gt
</pre>
<p>and is ready to accept the next command.</p>
<p>Invoking functions is as simple. To print something on the command line or from within a script
   you can invoke the print() function. The print() function will print all passed arguments separated
   by a whitespace and a final line break.</p>
<pre>
&gt print("Value", 100, 200);
</pre>
<p>will result in</p>
<pre>
Value 100 200
&gt
</pre>
<p>When entering a function name without parentheses, the shell will invoke this function with the
   result of the previous command as argument. This can be quite handy, if you define functions which
   shall continue processing on the output of the previous function. However this functionality is
   only available when entering commands in the shell. When writing scripts, you need to store the result
   in a variable instead.</p>
<p>The help() function can be invoked with or without parentheses and it will display a short help text.
   The function itself is defined in the CONFIG.JS script, which is run as the initial configuration
   script when you start the shell.</p>
<p>Don't be surprised, if only a few commands are build-in commands. Most of the time you will write and
   use scripts to do something with the Smart Card Shell.</p>
<p>Variables can be assigned a value without prior declaration. The script interpreter will take
   care of the best storage type and any conversion necessary.</p>
<p>You can define global and local variables. Global variables are created when you first assign
   a value to it:</p>
<pre>
&gt globalVariable = "Test";
</pre>
   creates a global variable named <code>globalVariable</code> and with a string value "Test". Local variable are
   declared with a <code>var</code> prefix:
<pre>
&gt var localVariable = "Hello";
</pre>
<p>Local variables are only valid within the function in which they are defined.</p>

<h2>Running Scripts</h2>
<p>Most of the time you will run scripts that are either supplied with the Smart Card Shell or
   which you developed for your own purpose. A script can be compiled and executed using the
   <code>load()</code> method build into the scripting enviroment.</p>
<p>The <code>load()</code> method accepts a string as the script name:</p>
<pre>
&gt load("tools/explore.js");
</pre>
<p>Remember, that all commands entered in the shell must be valid JavaScript code.
   Specifying a full path requires you to escape the backslash character with an
   additional backslash, because this notation is required for string literals:</p>
<pre>
&gt load("c:\\myscripts\\explore.js");
</pre>
<p>For your own convenience and better portability to other operating systems, we
   recommend to use the forward slash instead. This does not need to be escaped:</p>
<pre>
&gt load("c:/myscripts/explore.js");
</pre>
<p>You can also run scripts from the "File" / "Run Script" menu or by entering CTRL-R.</p>
<p>The shell is using a simple scheme to map file names used in scripts to files in
   the operating environment. As a rule of thumb, all file names are resolved relative to
   the location of the script which is currently running. If a file cannot be found relative
   to the location of the script, then in turn the working directory and the installation directory is
   searched. See <a href="filelocation.html">Locating Files</a> for details.</p>
<p>The scripts supplied with the Smart Card Shell are located in directories underneath the
   installation directory (Usually "c:\Program Files\CardContact\Smart Card Shell 3"). The <code>tools</code>
   directory contains a number of scripts that provide support for common tasks. Other directories
   contain script for specific card applications (e.g. <a href="icaomrtd.html">ICAO MRTD</a>,
   <a href="emv.html">EMV</a>, <a href="geldkarte.html">GeldKarte</a>, <a href="egk.html">eGK</a>
   and <a href="hpc.html">HPC</a>)</p>

<h2>Selecting a Card Reader</h2>
<p>Unless you explicitly selected a card reader from the "Options" / "Reader Configuration", the shell will
   use the first card reader in the system as default reader. Once you select a card reader, the JavaScript
   variable <code>_scsh3.reader</code> will be set to the name of the reader. You can reference this
   <a href="settings.html">configuration variable</a> in your own scripts.</p>

<h2>Defining and Using Objects</h2>
<p>JavaScript supports object-oriented programming, but uses prototype objects rather than
   classes. A prototype object contains the common properties of all instances of the same object.
   Common properties can be, for example, constants and methods.</p>
<p>Objects are created using the <code>new</code> operator. Following the new operator you can define a function
   that acts as a constructor. You can pass arguments to this function to initialize the newly created object.</p>
<p>Constructor functions in JavaScript are similar to classes in Java. By defining a constructor function
   and assigning other functions to the prototype of a constructor you can build your own objects and
   methods. The following code shows the concept:</p>
<pre>
//
// Define constructor and class Point
//
function Point(x, y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
}

//
// Define method add() and assign to the prototype object, making it available
// for all instances created with the Point constructor function
//
Point.prototype.add = function(x, y) {
        this.x += x;
        this.y += y;
}

//
// Define a toString() method
//
Point.prototype.toString = function() {
        return("y = " + this.x + ", y = " + this.y);
}

var p = new Point(10, 20);

p.add(20, 10);
print(p);
</pre>

<p>The Smart Card Shell supports a large number of predefined classes (aka constructor functions) and methods
   to work with smart cards, cryptographic material, data structures and PKI services. See the main page for
   a complete reference of Global Platform and shell scripting classes.</p>
