<title>Smart Card Shell command reference</title>
</head>
<body>

	<h1>Smart Card Shell command reference</h1>
	<p>Both the SmartCardShellView and the script tags within test
		specifications use the SmartCardShell provided by CardContact as
		execution environment. The Smart Card Shell uses JavaScript as command
		and script language provided by the Mozilla Rhino Engine.</p>
	<p>
		Several GlobalPlatform and OpenSCDP scripting classes are already
		included. These are well documented by the authors at <a
			href="http://www.openscdp.org/scsh3/">http://www.openscdp.org/scsh3/</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Additionally HJP Consulting GmbH extends instances of the
		<code>Card</code>
		class with special methods to allow easier access to commands and
		protocols. Which commands and protocols you can use depends on the set
		of available plug-ins. Each plug-in providing additional functionality
		also extends this help section and you will find a description of the
		available commands in the subsections of this chapter.
	</p>
	<p>
		In general GlobalTester extends the functionality using methods and
		fields using the form of
		<code>card.gt_&lt;protocol&gt;_&lt;method&gt;(param, param, ...)</code>
		. Details on parameters, return values etc. can be found in the
		corresponding sections of this documentation.
